# Autonomous-moving-fan
Our Final Project is ‘ An automatic moving fan ‘ which is devised for the man in the one-room. In the summer(Especially this summer so scorching), most of the people is tired of everything and hates to move around, just Rest. In this Project, we just give some input(the size of Room, the relocation of the obstacles) to the Android App.. The fan identified the preset obstacles ( furniture, desk, huge object, etc ….) and avoid them, and then it moves across the path to the user destination.
